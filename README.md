# Project-Title-A-Deep-Learning-approach-for-COVID-19-Detection

Overview:

AI-COVID-19-Detector is an intelligent system designed to predict the likelihood of COVID-19 infection based on medical imaging or user-provided data. Using a trained deep learning model, the system analyzes patterns in medical images (e.g., chest X-rays) or symptoms input by users to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and screening.

Key Features:

Deep Learning Model: Uses Sequential Model Training to process and analyze medical data.

Web-Based Interface: A user-friendly website featuring pages like Home, About, Contact, Doctor, Testimonials, and Treatment Details.

Automated Analysis: AI-driven prediction engine using pre-trained models.

Interactive Dashboard: Provides graphical representation of results for easy interpretation.

Secure & Scalable: Built with Flask or Django backend for fast and secure data processing.

Stylized UI: Designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring smooth user interactions.

Technologies Used:

AI/ML Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras

Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Bootstrap, Font Awesome)

Backend: Flask / Django

Use Cases:

Assists healthcare professionals in preliminary COVID-19 screening.
Helps users analyze symptoms or medical images with AI-based predictions.
Can be adapted for other medical conditions beyond COVID-19 detection.

This project is a fusion of AI-driven analysis and an interactive web-based interface, offering an efficient tool for early diagnosis and awareness. 🚀
